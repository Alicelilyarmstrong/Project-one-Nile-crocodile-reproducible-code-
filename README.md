# üêäProject One-Nile crocodile reproducible codeüêä #
This is all the code for my paper, **‚ÄòExploring the impacts of anthropogenic change on Nile crocodile (*Crocodylus niloticus*) distributions over the last 150 years‚Äô**. This project was completed as part of my masters course (Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Research) at Imperial College London.

# Analyses #

Some code has been adapted from Cooper et al (2020):
Natalie Cooper, Jake Curry and Emily Buckingham. 2020. GitHub: nhcooper123/protecting-pangolins: Code for the paper. Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4266580. 


All the code used for plots and analysis is given in this repository. Below is a brief description of each script.


**01 Wrangling specimen occurrence data.Rmd-** This script takes georeferenced  Nile crcodile data and wrangles it.

**02 Plotting specimen occurrence data.Rmd-** This script allows you to visualize georeferenced Nile crocodile specimens from GBIF and the NHM (London).

**03 Modelling historical Nile crocodile occurrence with Maxent.Rmd**- This script runs a Maxent species distribution model on the historical Nile crocodile specimen data from GBIF and the NHM.

**04 Functions anthropocene data.R-** custom functions needed to run scripts 05 and 06.

**05 Land use extractions.Rmd-** This script gets land cover data  from specimen error polygons.

**06 Population extractions.Rmd-** This script gets human population data from specimen error polygons.

**07 Areas of overlap between historic and current ranges.Rmd-** This script runs code to explore the level of overlap between historic and current *C.niloticus*  ranges using a convex hull.

**08 Logistic general linear model.Rmd-** This script performs a general linear model with quasi binomial errors to measure the effects of human population size, density and land cover type on overlap between historic (museum specimen data) and present-day (IUCN data) *C.niloticus* distributions.
