# üêäProject One-Nile crocodile reproducible codeüêä #
This is all the code for my paper, ‚ÄòExploring the impacts of anthropogenic change on Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) distributions over the last 150 years‚Äô. This project was completed as part of my masters course (Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Research) at Imperial College London.

# Analyses #

All the code used for analysis is given in the repository. Below is a brief description of each script.

01 Wrangling specimen occurrence data.Rmd- This script takes georeferenced data for Nile crcodiles and wrangles these for later analysis.

02 Plotting specimen occurrence data.Rmd- This script allows you to visualize georeferenced Nile crocodile specimens from GBIF and the NHM (London).

03 Modelling historical Nile crocodile occurrence with Maxent.Rmd- This script runs a Maxent species distribution model on the historical Nile crocodile specimen data from GBIF and the NHM.

04 Functions anthropocene data.R- functions to make scripts 05 and 06 work.

05 Land use extractions.Rmd- This script takes extracts various types of land use data from the error polygons of the specimens.

06 Population extractions.Rmd- This script takes extracts various types of HPD data from the error polygons of the specimens.

07 Areas of overlap between historic and current ranges.Rmd- This script runs code to explore the level of overlap between historic and current ranges using a convex hull.

08 Logistic general linear model.Rmd-This script performs a general linear model with binomial errors to measure the effects of human population size, density and land cover type on overlap between historic (museum specimen data) and present-day (IUCN data) C.niloticus distributions
